# INTRODUCTION:
* Wiper is a fundamental part that is utilized to clear raindrops or any water off of the windscreen. Wipers are planned and made to clean the water off of a windscreen. Most vehicles have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the back window and the other on every front light. The wiper parts noticeable from outside the vehicle are the elastic edge, the wiper arm holding the sharp edge, a spring linkage, and portions of the wiper turns. The actual wiper has around six sections called pressure focuses or paws that are little arms under the wiper.The current framework utilizes a control tail to initiate the wiper and the most common way of pulling up the wiper is difficult.r needs to turn on and off the control tail and it will diminish the driver's focus during the driving. Accordingly, this framework is proposed to tackle this large number of issues. The idea of this wiper framework is like other ordinary wipers, yet this framework will be moved up to a programmed control framework by utilizing a controller.When water hits a devoted sensor situated on the windscreen, it sets off the wiper engine to move. isn't distinguished by sensor, the wiper will consequently stop. This will assist the driver with giving more focus and lessen the auto collision likelihood.

   
# COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES:
  * STM32F407 Discovery Board
  * LEDs
  * Push Button
  * Resistors
  * Power Supply
 # ADVANTAGES:
   * Rain sensors store water during rain events, allowing it to be available throughout the summer and winter.
   * It is quite simple to use.
   * As a consequence, rain sensor-based equipment like vehicle wipers and irrigation systems last longer since they only work when needed.
   * Individual rain sensors are fairly inexpensive.
   * Rain sensor-based systems are extremely simple to install.
   * To save money during wet seasons, turn off the irrigation system. Electricity bills are lowered as a consequence.
# DISADVANTAGES:
   * Rain sensors must make a decision within a few minutes to avoid erroneous detection of rain.
   * The entire system cost rises when more components, including a rain sensor, are required.
   * When water falls squarely on the rain sensor, the mechanism activates.
# 4W & H (WHO,WHAT,WHEN,WHERE,HOW):

# WHAT:
* The functional speed of a vehicle wiper is constrained by a wiper speed control instrument in view of downpour conditions. To produce, the control framework consolidates a downpour sensor (30) that identifies downpour conditions. The adequacy of a simple sign relies upon the identified downpour conditions.

# WHY:
* To keep the windscreen clean enough to give adequate view at all times. 
* The windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.

# WHO:
* A wiper speed control system for an automobile manages the wiper's functioning speed in response to weather conditions.

# HOW:
* You can adjust the speed of the car wiper system according to the rainfall.

This venture gives practically all the fundamental data expected to begin with STM32F407 Discovery Board and furthermore advancement of driver code.
* Hardware Used : STM32F4 DISCOVERY kit, for more information visit: STM32F4 DISCOVERY
* Software Tool : STM32cubeIDE, for more information visit: STM32CubeIDE
* For installation of STM32CubeIDE refer Youtube
* Note : As this microcontroller has many advanced features and the main aim of this project is to get all basic insights, during the driver development only the required functionalities are added and other advanced functionality is not added. I may update the driver and other functionality in the future.
Please find the STM32F4 Discovery User Manual,STM32F4xxx Reference Manual (RM0090) and other related documents inside a folder called Documents. I will be referring to these documents for information such as block diagrams, register details ect.
