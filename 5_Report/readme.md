# INTRODUCTION:
* Wiper is a fundamental part that is utilized to clear raindrops or any water off of the windscreen. Wipers are planned and made to clean the water off of a windscreen. Most vehicles have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the back window and the other on every front light. The wiper parts noticeable from outside the vehicle are the elastic edge, the wiper arm holding the sharp edge, a spring linkage, and portions of the wiper turns. The actual wiper has around six sections called pressure focuses or paws that are little arms under the wiper.The current framework utilizes a control tail to initiate the wiper and the most common way of pulling up the wiper is difficult.r needs to turn on and off the control tail and it will diminish the driver's focus during the driving. Accordingly, this framework is proposed to tackle this large number of issues. The idea of this wiper framework is like other ordinary wipers, yet this framework will be moved up to a programmed control framework by utilizing a controller.When water hits a devoted sensor situated on the windscreen, it sets off the wiper engine to move. isn't distinguished by sensor, the wiper will consequently stop. This will assist the driver with giving more focus and lessen the auto collision likelihood.

   
# COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES:
  * STM32F407 Discovery Board
  * LEDs
  * Push Button
  * Resistors
  * Power Supply
 # ADVANTAGES:
   * Rain sensors store water during rain events, allowing it to be available throughout the summer and winter.
   * It is quite simple to use.
   * As a consequence, rain sensor-based equipment like vehicle wipers and irrigation systems last longer since they only work when needed.
   * Individual rain sensors are fairly inexpensive.
   * Rain sensor-based systems are extremely simple to install.
   * To save money during wet seasons, turn off the irrigation system. Electricity bills are lowered as a consequence.
# DISADVANTAGES:
   * Rain sensors must make a decision within a few minutes to avoid erroneous detection of rain.
   * The entire system cost rises when more components, including a rain sensor, are required.
   * When water falls squarely on the rain sensor, the mechanism activates.
